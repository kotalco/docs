Using Ethereum `Node` custom resource, you can deploy a node that joins a public network by setting `spec.network` parameter, or setting `spec.genesis` to start or join private network.

In this example, we will create private Proof of Authority network using Clique consensus algorithm.

## Deploy Private Network Node

## Deploy a Second Node

## Call JSON-RPC Method `net_peerCount`
